# Layout Playground

This is a place where I can experiment with designs and try to implement interesting designs I see across websites from scratch (well, mostly from scratch since I am using vue...)

## The Idea ðŸ’¡
The idea here is to gain a deeper understanding of CSS/SCSS, animations, and other things by creating UIs without the use of CSS libraries, like Bootstrap or Ant Design.

## The Goal ðŸ¥…
The end goal is to become better at writing CSS/SCSS and just styling in general. I've been saying "I'm not good at styling things", but I haven't really taken the time to understand why. This repo serves as a practice space and an opportunity to grow as a developer.

## An example exercise

## How do I run this?
1. Clone this repo
2. Run `yarn` to install dependencies
3. Run `yarn dev` to start the server
